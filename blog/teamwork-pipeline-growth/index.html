      <h1></h1>
<p>In the first half of 2022, we managed to increase our ICP pipeline by 30% and achieve a 96% increase in demo request value. Here's the strategy that made it possible.</p>
<p>When I joined Teamwork in December 2021, I was tasked with reshaping our global paid media strategy. The company had already established a strong product and market presence, but there were significant opportunities to optimize our demand generation approach, particularly in how we targeted and engaged with our ideal customer profiles (ICPs).</p>
<h2>The Challenge: Balancing Volume and Quality</h2>
<p>Like many B2B SaaS companies, we faced the classic marketing dilemma: how to increase qualified leads without sacrificing quality. Our existing paid media strategy was generating a decent volume of leads, but many weren't converting to high-value opportunities.</p>
<h2>The primary issues we identified were:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Broad targeting that captured leads outside our ICP</li>
<li>Inconsistent messaging across channels</li>
<li>Limited use of intent data to prioritize accounts</li>
<li>Inefficient budget allocation across regions and campaigns</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Solution: A Multi-faceted Approach</h2>
<p>Instead of making incremental changes, we developed a comprehensive strategy that transformed our approach to paid media. Here are the key components:</p>
<ol>
<li>Redefined Targeting Parameters</li>
</ol>
<p>First, we tightened our targeting parameters across all channels. This meant being more specific about company size, industry verticals, and job roles. We also implemented exclusion lists for organizations that historically showed low conversion rates.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Account-Based Marketing Integration</li>
</ol>
<p>We integrated our paid media efforts with our broader ABM strategy. This allowed us to create tiered approaches based on account value and engagement level, ensuring our highest-value prospects received personalized experiences.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Advanced Bidding Strategies</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the most impactful changes was developing sophisticated bidding strategies that leveraged machine learning while maintaining human oversight. We created custom scripts that adjusted bids based on multiple signals including:</p>
<p>Historical conversion data by segment<br>
Intent signals from third-party platforms<br>
On-site engagement metrics<br>
CRM data integration points<br>
4. Content Sequencing</p>
<p>Rather than presenting the same call-to-action to all prospects, we implemented content sequencing based on engagement history. This created natural progression paths that built trust before asking for high-commitment actions like demo requests.</p>
<p>The Results: Exceeding Expectations</p>
<p>By the end of H1 2022, the results exceeded our initial projections:</p>
<p>30% growth in pipeline from ideal customer profiles<br>
96% increase in demo request value<br>
42% improvement in cost per qualified opportunity<br>
Shorter sales cycles for accounts engaged through our paid media channels<br>
Key Learnings</p>
<p>While the specifics of our strategy were tailored to Teamwork's business model, there are several transferable insights that can benefit other B2B marketers:</p>
<p>Quality Over Quantity</p>
<p>Accepting lower lead volume in exchange for higher quality leads ultimately drives better business outcomes. Don't be afraid to narrow your targeting if it means connecting with the right prospects.</p>
<p>Cross-Functional Alignment is Critical</p>
<p>Our success depended on tight alignment between marketing, sales, and customer success teams. Regular communication and shared metrics were essential to refining our approach.</p>
<p>Test Beyond the Conversion</p>
<p>Look beyond immediate conversion metrics to understand the quality of leads generated. Tracking prospects through the entire funnel reveals insights that surface-level metrics miss.</p>
<p>Embrace Complexity with Clear Frameworks</p>
<p>Modern B2B marketing requires complex, multi-channel approaches, but that doesn't mean they should be complicated to manage. Develop clear frameworks that organize your efforts without oversimplifying them.</p>
<p>Looking Forward</p>
<p>As we continue to refine our approach, we're exploring several promising avenues, including:</p>
<p>Deeper integration of first-party data signals<br>
More sophisticated account scoring models<br>
Expansion of industry-specific messaging variations<br>
Advanced attribution modeling to better understand channel interactions<br>
The B2B demand generation landscape continues to evolve rapidly, but the fundamentals remain constant: understand your ideal customers deeply, create relevant experiences that address their needs, and maintain a relentless focus on quality throughout the funnel.</p>
